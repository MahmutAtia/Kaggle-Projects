Good old all American James Stewart appearing as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner. Had I been casting the film, the part of Kralik would have been perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed in with all the other European accents would have been nothing. Stewart had some of the same problem in the Mortal Storm also with Margaret Sullavan.<br /><br />Margaret Sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen, he did four films with her. But is only this one where neither of them dies. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in New York. In fact Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda back then.<br /><br />I think only Clark Gable was able to carry off being an American in a cast of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty. Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were American as well so nothing stood out. <br /><br />But if you can accept Stewart, than you'll be seeing a fine film from Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is pretty simple, a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest don't get along in person. But it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other. Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife. <br /><br />Though the leads are fine and Frank Morgan departs from his usual befuddled self, the two players who come off best are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions. He makes himself very scarce.<br /><br />And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to Frank Morgan. You really hate people like that, I've known too many like Schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day. Sad that it pays off a good deal of the time.\n","  Seniment:\n","  positive\n","  \n","\n","  The Review :\n","  Charles \"Chic\" Sales is absolutely terrific as the sole member of the Leeds family willing to testify against a gangster they saw murder a policeman and an informant. He fought at Bull Run in the Civil War and his patriotism runs high, even after his son-in-law is beaten and one of his grandson's is kidnapped by the gang, intimidating all the other members. Fear of his grandson's death is no excuse, he says. He wouldn't want his grandson living in a country run by gangsters anyway. The conflict between civic duty and personal safety is driven home sharply in this Oscar-nominated story. Walter Huston is also a standout as the hard driving district attorney threatening the family with perjury if they don't back up their identification of the killer in court. The rest of the cast, including the sleazy killer, Ralph Ince, are all excellent, and the film is snappily directed by William A. Wellman. There's also good suspense, as Sales disappears just as the trial is about to begin.\n","  Seniment:\n","  positive\n","  \n","\n","  The Review :\n","  What a clunker!<br /><br />It MUST have been made for TV or Cable.<br /><br />Look: forget the screenplay - forget the bunch of forgettable actors. Excuse me? Continuity? The NSA/NIA/whatever or whoever he is (an agent) takes-off in an F16 - is shown in an F18 chucking his guts up and, later, the aircraft shown taxiing is an F4 Phantom! Oooh, wish that I could be so cavalier.<br /><br />Apart from the male actors(!?) The women are WASPS: blue-eyed and long-legged and, eventually, get to cry about the heroes who save them. Even when a solid weld could save most of the cosmo- astro-nauts, the blond drops the welding tool. Duh!<br /><br />As an SF movie one out of ten. As a movie per se: 1/2 (that's a half point). They should have ditched the space station and headed for Mars.<br /><br />Major raspberries.\n","  Seniment:\n","  negative\n","  \n","\n","  The Review :\n","  I loved the blood and gore. The kind of violence is what Alien and Predator movies are about which is no one is spared. This truly answers the question of how it would be like if aliens were on Earth. The answer to that is simple. We are screwed. The effects were beautiful. How ever there are some real problems with it.<br /><br />1) The acting was horrible on the part of the Human characters side witch almost put me to sleep because of how dry and boring it was which really interrupted the flow of the movie and was very annoying. The writers could have done SOOOOOOO much better. The good part was the Alien and Predator acting which I thought was done very well for the most part.<br /><br />2) The size of the Predator ship was much smaller then how it was in the first AvP movie. This I scratched my head on <br /><br />3) Predators having their mask on while still in the ship. This upset people and I cant understand why. Its not a plot hole like most people make it to be. So I say to you people calm the hell down. Its no big deal. If it will make you feel better, remember, they did have face-hugger's on bored in storage so that could be a good reason why.<br /><br />4) Predator firing its plasma caster inside the ship. I thought that was rather stupid on the Predators part. But then I began to think if it was a younger Predator that panicked.<br /><br />5)The hunter and his son almost instantly arriving at the crash site after it fell several miles away. At least they didn't bore us by showing them run through the woods for 30 min. so be happy about that.<br /><br />6) Why did only one Predator go? I thought this was odd. But then I thought that it was because he thought it was only one Predalien that he was dealing with and not an outbreak.<br /><br />7) Why didn't the Predators in the ship self destruct? Well if people were paying attention one did, but he was killed before he could completely activate it.<br /><br />8) The unlimited blue melting goo. I thought that was rather dumb.<br /><br />9) Predator hiding evidence with the goo but skins a cop. That was also dumb.<br /><br />10) The black out. Well come on people, an Alien and Pred did fight it out at a power station.<br /><br />11) Predalien being half face-hugger/queen. This really ticked me off. I am an Alien and Pred fanatic. I know for a fact that Aliens DO NOT DO THAT!! Just like they don't give birth like a human does like they showed in Alien4!! Out of all the comics, games, books, and the movies 1,2, and 3, CLEARLY shows their behavior. They need a queen to lay eggs, the eggs hatch into face-hugger's, face-hugger's infect host, the parasite pops out and kills host and grows into a drone if it infects a human, a Predalien with a Predator, and Runner with any kind of four legged animal. And then after living for years upon years then they molt into a Preatorian (a mini me queen that does not lay eggs) I can go on and on but I wont. But that scene alone nearly ruined the movie for me. If the directors are smart they would go back and edit that by making a face hugger infecting the pregnant women.<br /><br />Any way if you are going to see this movie, just go see it for the Aliens and Predators. And when the scene comes up where the Predalin infects that pregnant women... Close your eyes so you don't have to see that insult to the Alien and Pred universe.\n","  Seniment:\n","  negative\n","  \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Preprocessing The Texts"],"metadata":{"id":"pt4l9eVxB0s3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["picking one value to test on"],"metadata":{"id":"Fh7pziD_DN1k"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Removing HTML Tags"],"metadata":{"id":"rMGo7dtnG5zd"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["value = df_copy.iloc[0]"],"metadata":{"id":"7PboXAHdDHEX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1671345598059,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Mahmoud Atia Ead Atia","userId":"11781797524477583668"}}},"execution_count":183,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["value[\"review\"]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":174},"id":"1pIbU5tR9wPa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1671345598060,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Mahmoud Atia Ead Atia","userId":"11781797524477583668"}},"outputId":"79ae32ff-0643-401e-a7e4-ef1ef7cfe99c"},"execution_count":184,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked.

length : 351\n","Sentence : In the midst of a documentary about his parents the filmmakers mother dies but he continues making the documentary discovering a story he did not anticipate The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience The narrative thus has a double weave the story of the documentary and the story of the documentarymakerOur admiration is with the filmmaker not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents relationship but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama Although the stuff of Hollywood lurks in the details Doug Block treats the story as he would everyday life For those of us who have always speculated about our parents life before we came on the scene or after we arrived but while we were too self absorbed to notice they had a life independent of ourselves  Birch Street gives fair warning There are wondrous things back there in fatherland but beware if you choose to enter thereBut that caution is for the audience to go slow wandering about in the details of their parents past It is not a warning for those offered a glimpse into the life of Blocks parents The film is a marvel at making the mother come alive as a vibrant and passionate yet introspective person who makes her own conscious decisions during the s The filmmakers particular success is to make the viewers actually see the young woman behind the elderly parent and grandparent We all know our parents were once young and vigorous but in  Birch Street the mother is The father who has been distant while the filmmaker and his sister were growing up ultimately remains distant in the film but that is due more to his own elusive nature than to his portrayal This biography turned autobiography is dramatic intense and unforgettable sure to send viewers scurrying for a closer look at their own family albums but more hesitant about looking at the backs of those photographs\n","Sentence emmbedings : [[[-0.02171999 -0.02994374  0.02245532 ... -0.02988291  0.0198715\n","   -0.02600467]\n","
