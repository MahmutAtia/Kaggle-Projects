Tom Cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life. He takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist. This film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break.<br /><br />Its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. You cannot really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced the bad (the sour). The theme will really get you to \"open your eyes\".<br /><br />Only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand. I think the end is perfect though. I recommend you watch it and see for yourself.\n","  Seniment:\n","  positive\n","  \n","\n","  The Review :\n","  I found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid-50's white mans body. He doesn't realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before. He listens to rap music, sings along, and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man. The real humor in this movie was watching the trouble that this behavior gets him into with the black community.\n","  Seniment:\n","  positive\n","  \n","\n","  The Review :\n","  Arguebly Al Pacino's best role. He plays Tony Montana, A small time hood from Cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in Miami, and he does it with the only two things he's got in this world, his balls and his word, and he doesn't break'em for nobody. Starts as doing jobs for a big time Cuban dealer, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon he has an eye for the boss's sexy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony to his position, he attempts to assassin Tony but with no luck. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. the film has a great supporting cast among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumpy gangster, another familiar face is Harris Yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down Tony, Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's young sister. Credits to the Ecxellent screenplay by Oliver Stone. This film is one of Brian DePalma's Brightest points in his long ups and downs career, you can see this guy is very talented. The movie has a magnificent look to it. Also pay attention for two memorable scenes: The one at the fancy restaurant (\"Say goodnight to the bad guy\"). the other is the final shootout where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 assassins that invaded to his house. this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie I have ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime movies it's a must-see. For the rest of you it's highly recommended. 10/10\n","  Seniment:\n","  positive\n","  \n","\n","  The Review :\n","  This film was not about stereotypes, nor dance moves, nor pickup lines, really. This film was about the vulnerability of peoples' hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play in a convincing role, that Will Smith could satisfy without action, and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way. I don't intend to sound overly endeared with this film - it wasn't \"groundbreaking\" in any sort of way - but it was a film worth seeing. Was it believable? No. New York couldn't be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the \"hutzpah\" of Hitch. Sure, there are bar-studs, but not ones that can get any chick, at any time - excluding those raking in seven figures, of course. The thing that worked best for this film was its true focus on the dramatic side of things, not just on the comedy. It was a funny two hours, no doubt. But it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat, become immersed in the characters, and smile.\n","  Seniment:\n","  positive\n","  \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Preprocessing The Texts"],"metadata":{"id":"pt4l9eVxB0s3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["picking one value to test on"],"metadata":{"id":"Fh7pziD_DN1k"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Removing HTML Tags"],"metadata":{"id":"rMGo7dtnG5zd"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["value = df_copy.iloc[0]"],"metadata":{"id":"7PboXAHdDHEX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1671907190819,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":50,"user":{"displayName":"Mahmoud Atia Ead Atia","userId":"11781797524477583668"}}},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["value[\"review\"]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":145},"id":"1pIbU5tR9wPa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1671907190820,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":51,"user":{"displayName":"Mahmoud Atia Ead Atia","userId":"11781797524477583668"}},"outputId":"f485b193-ab0e-4411-90ef-6ed479cb5b48"},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked.
