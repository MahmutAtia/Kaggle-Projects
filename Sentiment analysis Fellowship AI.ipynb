And, I hated Blair Witch Project,so go figure? This is about as staged as it gets & yes they do insult your intelligence by trying to make it seem real.I really liked the madame lalaurie storyline though it's more than likely made up. But, the main reason I like this film, is fake or not when the ghosts start attacking & kidnapping them,I get chill-bumps every time & have to look behind me as it feels like something's there with me.i know it's my imagination, but hey more than half of the drivel that is horror in today's cinemas & DVD's doesn't give me goosebumps,so that makes this a creepy delight.Not for everyone, as skeptics will hate it & not for gorehounds as with a PG-13 rating there is no gore.

I'm always intrigued by a story of hope and overcoming life altering events, and this was no exception.<br /><br />The background of the characters that is provided gives you a sense of the family's closeness and how they positively affected each others' lives. I can't speak to the accuracy of specific details in this movie, it is customary to take some creative license when organizing a script. However, the spirit of Dan and his family is what matters here.<br /><br />Its a worthwhile movie of a story that should be told. I felt empathy for the characters and cheered at the end.\n","  Seniment:\n","  positive\n","  \n","\n","  The Review :\n","  This movie deals with the European ERASMUS exchange program but more generally about the European youth.

I watched it despite the fact that I don't like the pretentious kind of stuff that Alan Hollinghurst writes (sorry to his fans but I think we have a case of the emperor's new clothes with this author's work). I admit that the acting is excellent, it is beautifully shot and I was reasonably entertained by it - however- I found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production. The 'explicit' gay sex that the media droned on about has all been done before on TV - several times - so it was nothing very shocking I'm afraid. Full marks for production values but low ones for storyline/content I'm afraid.\n","  Seniment:\n","  negative\n","  \n","\n","  The Review :\n","  This is a very strange series with Dean Learner.

I don't know if this classes as a spoiler but the guests aren't real like in Ali g or anything they're played by one man or so i believe. I love the serious look that he's got going on. Its like that programme that was on on a Sunday morning that i forget the name of lol. I also really like the suit and moustache thing he has got going on. Its quite hot.

bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling Gentleman Jim the best boxing movie ever made That is the Robert WisePaul Newman flick Somebody Up There Likes Me That movie might be number  but Gentleman Jim is a close number The movie doesnt just chronicle the rise of James J Corbett it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition In the late s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bareknuckle rules to the more gentlemanly days of the gloved Marquis of Queensbury rules And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectabilityGentleman Jim is not a realistic look at those days It is romanticized and yes even a bit hokey at times But always delightfully so Errol Flynn is perfect as the Gentleman Jim who really isnt a gentleman at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family Alexis Smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a lovehate relationship and we all know it is of course love that will win that match in the endAt the end of Gentleman Jim the great John L Sullivan whose famous line was NOT I can lick any man in the world of courseromanticism again hands over his belt to Corbett This is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made Realistic No But wonderful Hey if you

and then lost in the snow The killer now takes on the form of a snowman  if you can believe that The snowman Jack Frost is after the country town Sherif who put him behind bars In doing so Jack Frost

\n","\n","  The Review :\n","  Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome Caligula is not made in the style of swordandsandal epics like Spartacus or Gladiator That style of moviemaking was out of favour in the late seventies Rather it more closely resembles a cross between a softcore porn movie and a video nasty At least the shortened  minute version does I have never seen the full  minute version but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page it would seem closer to a cross between a hardcore porn movie and a video nasty As one would expect from a film produced by the publisher of Penthouse there is much naked flesh to be seen and the film lovingly catalogues Caligulas sexual perversions including his incestuous affair with his sister Drusilla What is perhaps unexpected from the publisher of a magazine so closely associated with the heterosexual male lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as female on display and distinctly homoerotic overtones to many scenes The obsession with sex is balanced by an equal obsession with violence as though Bob Guccione Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass were trying to kill two taboos with one stone It is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazen film should be called Brass and the scriptwriter of such a gory one should be called Gore Characters are put to death or mutilated in a variety of sadistic ways and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape The Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were certainly known for their debauched lifestyles so the films concentration on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate I do however question whether such a concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in Roman history Both The Fall of the Roman Empire and Gladiator were set during the reign of Commodus an Emperor quite as cruel and licentious as Caligula In neither case did the filmmakers find it necessary to turn their film into a mixture of Up Pompeii Emmanuelle and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and both those films are artistically far better than CaligulaThe acting in the film is not particularly bad with a few exceptions such as the horribly wooden Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla Malcolm McDowell makes a suitably insane Caligula Suitable that is in the context of this film The real Caligula was doubtless both cruel and eccentric but historians have debated whether he was actually mentally ill The great mystery is exactly why so many distinguished British actors should have agreed to take part in such a trashy production In the case of Helen Mirren the only Dame of the British Empire with a past as a porn star it was probably connected to her rather regrettable tendency to alternate between the highbrow and the sleazy but heaven alone knows what Peter OToole and John Gielgud thought they were doing Unlike some other famous stage actors such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton Gielgud did not always look completely at home in the cinema but here he gives a dignified interpretation of the role of Nerva a decent and honourable Senator of the old school Unfortunately in the context of this film any attempt at dignity is as out of place as a pearl on a dunghill Guccione clearly succeeded in his ambition for this film to become something of a cult classic of decadence Whether Brass and Vidal had quite the same ambition for the film is open to question The film does not however succeed upon any other level either as art cinema or as a study of the politics of dictatorship Even seen as erotica it is secondrate \n","  Seniment:\n","  negative\n","  \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Spilt to train
