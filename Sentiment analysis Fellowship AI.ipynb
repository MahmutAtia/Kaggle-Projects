Good old all American James Stewart appearing as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner. Had I been casting the film, the part of Kralik would have been perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed in with all the other European accents would have been nothing. Stewart had some of the same problem in the Mortal Storm also with Margaret Sullavan.<br /><br />Margaret Sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen, he did four films with her. But is only this one where neither of them dies. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in New York. In fact Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda back then.<br /><br />I think only Clark Gable was able to carry off being an American in a cast of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty. Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were American as well so nothing stood out. <br /><br />But if you can accept Stewart, than you'll be seeing a fine film from Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is pretty simple, a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest don't get along in person. But it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other. Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife. <br /><br />Though the leads are fine and Frank Morgan departs from his usual befuddled self, the two players who come off best are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions. He makes himself very scarce.<br /><br />And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to Frank Morgan. You really hate people like that, I've known too many like Schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day. Sad that it pays off a good deal of the time.\n","  Seniment:\n","  positive\n","  \n","\n","  The Review :\n","  Charles \"Chic\" Sales is absolutely terrific as the sole member of the Leeds family willing to testify against a gangster they saw murder a policeman and an informant. He fought at Bull Run in the Civil War and his patriotism runs high, even after his son-in-law is beaten and one of his grandson's is kidnapped by the gang, intimidating all the other members. Fear of his grandson's death is no excuse, he says. He wouldn't want his grandson living in a country run by gangsters anyway. The conflict between civic duty and personal safety is driven home sharply in this Oscar-nominated story. Walter Huston is also a standout as the hard driving district attorney threatening the family with perjury if they don't back up their identification of the killer in court. The rest of the cast, including the sleazy killer, Ralph Ince, are all excellent, and the film is snappily directed by William A. Wellman. There's also good suspense, as Sales disappears just as the trial is about to begin.\n","  Seniment:\n","  positive\n","  \n","\n","  The Review :\n","  What a clunker!<br /><br />It MUST have been made for TV or Cable.<br /><br />Look: forget the screenplay - forget the bunch of forgettable actors. Excuse me? Continuity? The NSA/NIA/whatever or whoever he is (an agent) takes-off in an F16 - is shown in an F18 chucking his guts up and, later, the aircraft shown taxiing is an F4 Phantom! Oooh, wish that I could be so cavalier.<br /><br />Apart from the male actors(!?) The women are WASPS: blue-eyed and long-legged and, eventually, get to cry about the heroes who save them. Even when a solid weld could save most of the cosmo- astro-nauts, the blond drops the welding tool. Duh!<br /><br />As an SF movie one out of ten. As a movie per se: 1/2 (that's a half point). They should have ditched the space station and headed for Mars.<br /><br />Major raspberries.\n","  Seniment:\n","  negative\n","  \n","\n","  The Review :\n","  I loved the blood and gore. The kind of violence is what Alien and Predator movies are about which is no one is spared. This truly answers the question of how it would be like if aliens were on Earth. The answer to that is simple. We are screwed. The effects were beautiful. How ever there are some real problems with it.<br /><br />1) The acting was horrible on the part of the Human characters side witch almost put me to sleep because of how dry and boring it was which really interrupted the flow of the movie and was very annoying. The writers could have done SOOOOOOO much better. The good part was the Alien and Predator acting which I thought was done very well for the most part.<br /><br />2) The size of the Predator ship was much smaller then how it was in the first AvP movie. This I scratched my head on <br /><br />3) Predators having their mask on while still in the ship. This upset people and I cant understand why. Its not a plot hole like most people make it to be. So I say to you people calm the hell down. Its no big deal. If it will make you feel better, remember, they did have face-hugger's on bored in storage so that could be a good reason why.<br /><br />4) Predator firing its plasma caster inside the ship. I thought that was rather stupid on the Predators part. But then I began to think if it was a younger Predator that panicked.<br /><br />5)The hunter and his son almost instantly arriving at the crash site after it fell several miles away. At least they didn't bore us by showing them run through the woods for 30 min. so be happy about that.<br /><br />6) Why did only one Predator go? I thought this was odd. But then I thought that it was because he thought it was only one Predalien that he was dealing with and not an outbreak.<br /><br />7) Why didn't the Predators in the ship self destruct? Well if people were paying attention one did, but he was killed before he could completely activate it.<br /><br />8) The unlimited blue melting goo. I thought that was rather dumb.<br /><br />9) Predator hiding evidence with the goo but skins a cop. That was also dumb.<br /><br />10) The black out. Well come on people, an Alien and Pred did fight it out at a power station.<br /><br />11) Predalien being half face-hugger/queen. This really ticked me off. I am an Alien and Pred fanatic. I know for a fact that Aliens DO NOT DO THAT!! Just like they don't give birth like a human does like they showed in Alien4!! Out of all the comics, games, books, and the movies 1,2, and 3, CLEARLY shows their behavior. They need a queen to lay eggs, the eggs hatch into face-hugger's, face-hugger's infect host, the parasite pops out and kills host and grows into a drone if it infects a human, a Predalien with a Predator, and Runner with any kind of four legged animal. And then after living for years upon years then they molt into a Preatorian (a mini me queen that does not lay eggs) I can go on and on but I wont. But that scene alone nearly ruined the movie for me. If the directors are smart they would go back and edit that by making a face hugger infecting the pregnant women.<br /><br />Any way if you are going to see this movie, just go see it for the Aliens and Predators. And when the scene comes up where the Predalin infects that pregnant women... Close your eyes so you don't have to see that insult to the Alien and Pred universe.\n","  Seniment:\n","  negative\n","  \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Preprocessing The Texts"],"metadata":{"id":"pt4l9eVxB0s3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["picking one value to test on"],"metadata":{"id":"Fh7pziD_DN1k"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Removing HTML Tags"],"metadata":{"id":"rMGo7dtnG5zd"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["value = df_copy.iloc[0]"],"metadata":{"id":"7PboXAHdDHEX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1671345598059,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Mahmoud Atia Ead Atia","userId":"11781797524477583668"}}},"execution_count":183,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["value[\"review\"]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":192},"id":"1pIbU5tR9wPa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1671345598060,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Mahmoud Atia Ead Atia","userId":"11781797524477583668"}},"outputId":"79ae32ff-0643-401e-a7e4-ef1ef7cfe99c"},"execution_count":184,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked.

portraying the innermost emotions  dilemma sorrow love esp its the directors debut read from somewhere is it true I felt that somethings not quite right maybe its just me Im not drawn to the characters enough to immerse me in their world This is a simple story about ordinary people ordinary lives Through simple and short dialogs the director tries to relate a simple guys life and how copes with the news of his illness by laughing it away every time Oh ya his laughter was kinda cute at first but gradually it gets to me such a deep hearty roar for a gentle man I must say I didnt feel the impact that most readers felt in fact I was more drawn to the trivial scenarios like spitting of watermelon seeds with his sis that clearly shows that theyre comfortable with each other the granny who came back for another shot  this is kinda melancholic the thoughtful gesture of writing down the procedures for his dad  hmm but this is predictable Dont misunderstood that Im an actionlover independent films are my cup of tea Perhaps I just have a really high expectation after watching many deep films that have stronger imagery Some Asian films worth the watch Tony Takitani depicts loneliness Wayward Cloud only  dialog My Sassy Girl I like it  loneliness as well  gangsters lives in local setting Before sunrise and Before sunset I just have to mention these even though

enough talky scenes and unlikeable as well as stupid characters to make you wish somebody would shoot anybody like really fastBring a pillow',\n","        'There are no saving graces in this dreadful stagey boring snoozefest which brings to mind The Ransom Of Red Chief Even though there are some big stars in this film the acting is almost uniformly terrible Glenn Ford normally a laidback kind of guy hams it up with forced emotion Donna Reed is so overthetop as to prove laughable Leslie Nielson is woefully miscast and is terrible The son is such a repulsive little brat I found myself rooting for the kidnappers The only decent performance in this mishmash is the relatively minor role of the butler Perhaps Im being too harsh on the actors after all all they did were to read the lines given

\n","\n","  Reveiw : Robert Taylor definitely showed himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gunslinging buffalo hunter in this  western It was one of the few times that Taylor would play a heavy in a film Nonetheless this picture was far from great as shortly after this Taylor fled to television with the successful series The DetectivesStuart Granger hid his British accent and turned in a formidable performance as Taylors partner Taylor is a bigot here and his hatred for the Indians really showsAnother very good performance here was by veteran actor Lloyd Nolan as an aged drinking oldtimer who joined in the hunt for buffalo as well In his early scenes Nolan was really doing an excellent takeoff of Walter Huston in his Oscarwinning role in The Treasure of the Sierre Madre in  Note the appearance of Russ Tamblyn in the film The following year Tamblyn and Nolan would join in the phenomenal Peyton PlaceThe writing in the film is stiff at best By the films end its the elements of nature that did Taylor in How about the elements of the writing here\n","  true label : 0\n","  predicted : 1.0\n","  probabilty : 1.0\n","\n","  \n","\n","  Reveiw :  and in no way as clean logical and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired Hollywood clichesIm  and Ive spent  years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations Like the main character in the film I was successful mainly because of logic  because I kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality and to know what was really going on and what wasnt In the end I was really successful because of medication by the way but I certainly escaped madness because I knew before I took medication the difference between what was real and what wasntSo I feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud Not only does it cheat with the main characters story who wasnt faithful to his wife who was bisexual  something really important here but mostly it shows a comforting tamed view of schizophrenia  which is entirely missing the pointSchizophrenia is a mind structure not a disease A schizophrenic isnt a normal man with a disease its someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people  for him things like time space and peoples personalities arent solid things He feels it can be bent it can change it can mutate and maybe even disappear To cope with this a schizophrenic has a rich very imaginative inner world which normal people dont expect  but hes trapped in it because he cant relate with most people and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank delusive dead endThis is very different to whats depicted in this ridiculous cure tearjerking movie It should be violently frightening People other than the main character should appear strange weird and absurd like in Lynchs Eraserhead for example There should be really impressive weird gross hallucinations because thats what schizophrenia is all about Its not about detailsI mean watch Naked Lunch Lost Highway read PK Dicks Martian TimeSplit or Ubik DO watch The Cell Perfect Blue Dark City or play American McGees Alice on PC and you may have a vague idea of what its like Dont watch the feel good movie of the month with banal situations cleaned characters and visuals and stupid plot tricks The Cell is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenics mind his visions and his inner consistency  its violent weird confusing and very very scaryOnce again Schizophrenia isnt about details its not a neat tame trick played to you It jumps

Holmes has his work cut out to keep Dr Tobel alive so he can deliver his bomb sightDirected by Roy William Neill Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon was the fourth in a series of fourteen Holmes films made between    to feature Rathbone  Bruce as Holmes  Watson The script by Edward T Lowe Jr Scott Darling  Edmund L Hartmann is based on the short The Dancing Men by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle  isnt the tradition Holmes murder mystery as its more of a wartime adventure story To neglect what Holmes is all about the solving of complex crimes  mysteries is a big mistake as far as Im concerned  the involvement of the Nazis  the war as a backdrop to the story feels out of place awkward  just didnt sit too well with me The dialogue isnt great Professor Moriarty feels almost like an afterthought as if they couldnt come up with a villain for it  as a whole its far less engaging than others in the series However at least its shortDirector Neill does his usual efficient job but you have to cut it a little slack  bear in mind that it was made over  years ago It has no real style or imagination  lacks both atmosphere  intrigue as wellTechnically the film is OK if unspectacular the black and white cinematography is fine although I understand that a computer colourised version is also available The acting is alright Bruce  Hoey do their usual comic relief turns  Rathbones hairstyle in this looks ridiculous  Im glad he changed it for later instalmentsSherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon was a disappointment when compared to some of the other excellent entries in the series there is very little by which I can recommend it  everything that made the others so good seems to be missing here Leave this one till last  watch some of the better ones first for die hard fans only\n","  true

three act play is opened before us with the help of The Stage Manager a visual narrator if you like After his initial introductions we are lead into the homes of two particular families The Webbs and the GibbsThis is most definitely middle America at the turn of the century and the progressive way of life of the American Dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town Here we see the everyday lives of some of its  populace of Grovers Corners New Hampshire even if there are too the migrant Polish workers that add another  to is numbers they never get a lookinOnce the daily lives of these families have been introduced wives cooking children homeworking fathers working kids falling in love and the clean picketfences painted white the second act is started three years later after young George a young and unrecognisable William Holden then aged  and Emily have fallen in love and intend to marry Blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching too a turning point in their own lives from the nest they lived and now into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step The third act is slightly more sour and foreboding it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent here we see not life not celebration but death and it is in this predicament that the dead as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past are here to remind us to tell us that life and every last minute every precious breath is not to be wasted and squanderedIt is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on and by middle America and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order This isnt just about Our town this is moral diction aimed at Our souls and how America can better itself if its peoples excluding the Poles the Irish the Native American and the freed ethnic minorities and minorities in general plus the supporting backbone of the Americanas who still have not had a fair part in this narrative such as the middle classes can live up to the expectations of the American Dream through honest decent living The purveyors of the American Dream with special invitation onlyI was entertained slightly by this movie too but I felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting the musical score or how well or not it was made This was the movies intention to exclude other groups and to only include the likes of the Webbs and the Gibbs in the future of the developing country of the USA a good movie but also a slightly biased in its stance I thoughtTaken from the play by US born Thornton Wilder    this Pulitzer Prize winning play and six Academy Award nominated movie was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes Life love and death the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness Our Town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness like other towns nothing too exciting ever happens here if anything at all this town only has the right sort of people you can still leave your backdoor unlocked here we are seeing the developing lives of these two families but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves Our Town may just have been Any Town just as long as you came from the right part of town that is\n","  true label : 0\n","  predicted : 1.0\n","

Many of the lead characters in Hideo Goshas  film Hitokiri manslayer aka Tenchu  heavens punishment were actual historical figures in western nameorder format Ryoma Sakamoto Hampeita Takechi Shimbei Tanaka Izo Okada  Anenokoji The name Hitokiri a historical term refers to a group of four superswordsmen who carried out numerous assassinations of key figures in the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate in the mids under the orders of Takechi the leader of the Loyalist ie ultranationalist proEmperor faction of the Tosa clan What was this struggle about Sad to say you wont find out in this film Brilliant History Lesson indeedNo Gosha is much more interested in showing you the usual bloody slicing and dicing and at absurd length the inner torment of the notverybright killer Izo Okada than in revealing actual history Sakamoto for example was someone of historical significance considered to be the father of the Imperial Japanese Navy The closest Gosha comes to providing a history lesson is the scene in which Sakamoto whom Takechi considers a traitor to the Loyalist cause comes to Takechis mansion to try to sway him ideologically He begins by talking about the international political situation with foreign warships in Japans ports and a Japan that is too weak militarily to defend against them Want to know more Sorry Gosha cuts off this potentially fascinating lecture in mid sentence So much for informing his audience about a turning point in Japanese historyThe film left me in utter confusion about the aims of the two sides in this struggle For the two and a half centuries that the Shogunate held central power in Japan it was an institution dedicated to preventing social change to preserving the feudal relations of society It was fearful of outside contamination both ideological and technological In keeping with this spirit it outlawed firearms those instruments of leveling in Europe and the Americas with which a peasant could have stood up to a samurai Throughout this period the Emperor was nothing more than a spiritual figureheadBut in the towns which stood in neutral zones between the feudal fiefdoms a new class of merchants landlords and craftsmen was developing  the class known in Europe by its French name the bourgeoisie Inevitably as this new class gained strength it chafed against the many confines of feudal society As in Europe the king Emperor became the central figure in the bourgeoisies struggle for power against the feudal aristocracy But a political leadership does not always fully understand the interests of the class it serves When the outside world arrived with a bang in  in the form of US Admiral Perrys Black Ships the ruling elite of Japan was thrown into a crisis Their military was no match for these foreigners Also they had heard about the havoc the British and French imperialists were wreaking in China What should Japan do to save itself from the fate of its weak neighbor Surprisingly some elements within the usually isolationist Shogunate were inclined to open trade with the foreigners in order to obtain some of their advanced technology This is the point of view represented just barely in the film by Sakamoto On the other hand the Emperorloyal ultranationalists represented by Takechi believed they could keep out the foreigners by force if only they could prevent the other faction from selling out the country Sound familiar Thus the assassination of key Shogunate figures is in order  and away we goTakechis motivations were for me the films biggest puzzle Gosha suggests that he is fighting mainly for his personal advancement rather than for the Loyalist cause Can we take this to represent the tenor of the Loyalists as a whole Do you careSeveral reviewers have compared this film favorably with Goyokin which Gosha made in the same year But where Goyokin is a crackling suspenseful adventure yarn with a hero worthy of sympathy Hitokiri is plodding nowhere near as compelling and lacks such a hero Sakamoto could have been this films hero but we are not allowed to know him  nor what he stands for  well enough for him to achieve that statusIn view of his wonderful scores for five previous Kurosawa films Masaru Satos score here was very disappointing sounding like something rejected from a Bonanza episodeBarry Freed\n","  true label : 0\n","  predicted : 1.0\n","  probabilty : 1.0\n","\n","  \n","\n","  Reveiw : The s My Dinner with Andre with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory is essentially a dialog about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit s You Are Alone demonstrates how common worldly events can shatter the soul The story revolves around three principal characters Theres Daphne a pretty teenage student who frets about virtually every decision in her life Then theres the prostitute or paid escort Britney as selfconfident as Daphne is selfconscious What makes them interesting is that they share the same body if not the same personae Part of the magic of this film occurs in one of the early scenes where Daphne approaches a door of an aged hotel room She halts and is obviously torn by the decision of whether or not to knock on the door  but it is Britney that effortlessly glides into the room when the door is openedOn the other side of that door is Buddy a middleaged nobody with few if any personal qualities that anyone would find attractive He goes so far as to be confrontational about Britneys chosen profession as soon as she enters the room However we soon learn that Buddy is Daphnes nextdoor neighbor and has watched through the years as she grew from little girl to womanhood This complicates things for the audience Is Buddy just being a concerned neighbor or does he want something elseIf its sex that Buddy wants here it is Britney loves sex Her definitions may be Clintonesque but that doesnt lesson her enthusiasm She prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic wristbands that her clients are invited to chose from Each color band denotes a specific act that shell perform  but exactly which act isnt revealed until after the band is broken off her wrist and the choice is irrevocably made Britney is or believes that she is in control of every encounter Even when blindfolded and bound as she is by one of her regular clients she imagines her arms and body being stroked by multiple men but her legs and pubic area being caressed by a woman in blood red lingerie The films imagery just keeps comingBuddys pathetic life is one of acceptance Hes lost his wife his dog even his fantasies of the pretty teenager nextdoor Its no coincidence that hes lured Daphne or Britney to this particular hotel room Theres a painting on the wall of a dinner plate with only a fish head left This is a perfect metaphor for Buddys life all of the good parts are finished So its here where he brought his wife when they were still college students that he makes his stand  to regain some control of his own life to make his statementThe director of You Are Alone Gorman Bechard knows his craft The principal action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film assisted by a myriad of intercut scenes that add dimension to the characters their circumstances and conflictsAs the film progresses Britney asks Buddy if she should get undressed He says yes but she strips only to her underwear An actual prostitute would probably remove all of her clothes one of the professions five gets But it isnt Buddy thats being teased we are As the film concludes we find that there are far deeper human emotions and motivations in play A tease doesnt work unless it actually delivers Britney does so does You Are Alone\n","  true label : 1\n","  predicted : 0.0\n","  probabilty : 0.0\n","\n","  \n","\n","  Reveiw : After viewing several episodes of this series I have come to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any form of originality Here is an old science fiction standby ingeniously wrapped in the form of a truly original concept  and still they can only almost  make it workThe dialog is good The male actors are reasonably proficient at their professions Most of the characters are well drawn with special kudos to the hero and his more than likeable sidekick And most of the episode plots come across as palatable So what could be wrong How about the the female characters and the cosmeticly perfect actresses who are chosen to portray them The producers insist on portraying the female characters in this  almost good  series in a manner that makes the end product appear to be a misplaced cheerleader Why I ask whyThe episodes all fall flat whenever the female guest star or recurring character comes on screen These actresses are all totally unbelievable in their roles and you dont actually have to see them to know they are incapable of their acting assignments A blind person could tell Just listen to them talk They deliver their dialog with all the drama and effect of a  year old at the high school prom Who would believe these women are Phd scientist senators corporate executives and medical doctorsIn a nut shell if the producers have their choice of a Stockard Channing or a Morgan Fairchild guess who theyll choose  every time And of course the series suffers for it Too bad\n","  true label : 1\n","  predicted : 0.0\n","  probabilty : 0.0\n","\n","  \n","\n","  Reveiw : Hardly a masterpiece Not so well written Beautiful cinematography i think not This movie wasnt too terrible but it wasnt that much better than average The main story dealing with highly immoral teens should have focused more on the forbidden romance and why this was should have really gotten into it instead of scraping the surface with basically because mom says we cant Some parts should have been dropped altogether or reworked to have more importance to the plight of the two main characters Couple times i was wondering if the writerdirector was a fan of George Lucas classic American Graffiti Not that its wrong to be a fan of that movie but to make your movie at times look like that i mean come on Worst part of this was that Madchen Amick had such a small part i mean double come on She was the only one in one or two lines who actually tried a southern accent Take a good listen it was there even though her character was from California DOH Maybe if she was the star others could have followed and we would have had a more authentically sounding movie Oh well what can ya do when you have a director whos just a director and not an artist also Too bad Overall i give this a B and thats being a little generous cause im partial to Ms Amick\n","  true label : 1\n","  predicted : 0.0\n","  probabilty : 0.0\n","\n","  \n","\n","  Reveiw : black tar cant be snorted theres a documentary
